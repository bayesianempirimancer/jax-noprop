A JAX/Flax implementation of the NoProp algorithm from the paper "NoProp: Training Neural Networks without Back-propagation or Forward-propagation" by Li et al. (arXiv:2503.24322v1).

## Overview

NoProp is a novel approach for training neural networks without relying on standard back-propagation or forward-propagation steps, taking inspiration from diffusion and flow matching methods. This repository provides:

- **NoProp-DT**: Discrete-time implementation (Currently Broken)
- **NoProp-CT**: Continuous-time implementation with neural ODEs (fully optimized)
- **NoProp-FM**: Flow matching variant (fully optimized)

## Key Features

- **Highly Optimized**: JIT-compiled implementations with 1000x+ speedups
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with different model architectures
- **Flexible Model Interface**: Works with any model that takes `(z, x, t)` inputs and outputs `z'` with same shape as `z`
- **Advanced Noise Scheduling**: Multiple noise schedule types including learnable neural network-based schedules
- **Efficient Gamma Parameterization**: Uses `γ(t)` parameterization for numerical stability with `α(t) = sigmoid(γ(t))`
- **JAX/Flax**: High-performance implementation with automatic differentiation
- **Neural ODE Integration**: Built-in ODE solvers with scan-based optimization (Euler, Heun, RK4, Adaptive)
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Two moons dataset example with full visualization

```

## Architecture

The implementation follows the paper's architecture with several key improvements:

### Model Requirements

**Critical**: Any model used with NoProp must satisfy these requirements:

- **Input signature**: `model(z, x, t)` where:
  - `z`: Noisy target tensor `[batch_size, z_dim]`
  - `x`: Input data tensor `[batch_size, x_dim]` 
  - `t`: Time step tensor `[batch_size]` (can be `None` for discrete-time variants)
- **Output**: Must return `z'` with **exactly the same shape** as input `z`
- **Time handling**: For discrete-time variants, `t=None` is allowed

The `SimpleMLP` class provides a reference implementation that meets these requirements.

### Noise Schedules

The implementation uses a **gamma parameterization** for numerical stability:

- **Core relationship**: `α(t) = sigmoid(γ(t))` where `γ(t)` is an increasing function
- **Derived quantities**:
  - `σ(t) = sqrt(1 - α(t))` (noise coefficient)
  - `SNR(t) = α(t) / (1 - α(t)) = exp(γ(t))` (signal-to-noise ratio)
  - `SNR'(t) = γ'(t) * exp(γ(t))` (SNR derivative for loss weighting)

**Available schedules**:

1. **LinearNoiseSchedule**: `γ(t) = logit(t)`, `γ'(t) = 1/(t*(1-t))`
2. **CosineNoiseSchedule**: `γ(t) = logit(sin(π/2 * t))`, smooth transitions
3. **SigmoidNoiseSchedule**: `γ(t) = γ * (t - 0.5)`, `γ'(t) = γ` (constant)
4. **LearnableNoiseSchedule**: Neural network learns `γ(t)` with guaranteed monotonicity

**⚠️ Important Note on Noise Schedule Singularities**: Care should be taken to ensure that noise schedules do not have singularities at t=0 or t=1. Common schedules like Linear and Cosine have this problem because of the particular parameterization we use for the noise scuedules under the hood.  This is because we paramterize `γ(t)` directly and then compute  `α(t) = sigmoid(γ(t))`.  This means that common noise scuedules like  `α(t) = 1-t` are not really accessible.  As a result `CosineNoiseSchedule` and `LinearNoiseSchedule` implemented here are approximate so as to avoid singularities in things like `SRN'(t)`.

### Training Process

Each NoProp variant implements a different training strategy:

1. **NoProp-DT**: Time steps are associated with a single Resnet layer and each layer learns to denoise independently
2. **NoProp-CT**: Learns a vector field `dz/dt = f(z, x, t)` for continuous-time denoising via neural ODEs using SNR weighted loss
3. **NoProp-FM**: Learns a vector field `dz/dt = f(z, x, t)` for continuous-time denoising via neural ODEs using a simple field matching loss

### Key Implementation Details

- **Efficient computation**: Single `get_gamma_gamma_prime_t()` method computes both `γ(t)` and `γ'(t)` to avoid redundant calculations
- **Learnable schedules**: Neural network with positive weights and ReLU activations and a terminal rescaling ensures bounded monotonic `γ(t)`
- **ODE integration**: Built-in Euler, Heun, Runge-Kutta 4th order, and Adaptive methods with scan-based optimization
- **Unified integration interface**: Single `integrate_ode` function with `output_type` parameter for end-point or trajectory outputs
- **JIT optimization**: All critical methods are JIT-compiled for maximum performance
- **Modular utilities**: ODE integration and Jacobian utilities are organized in `src/jax_noprop/utils/` for better code organization

## Performance Optimizations

The implementation includes several key optimizations:

### JIT Compilation
- **`compute_loss`**: 3000x+ speedup with JIT compilation
- **`predict`**: 2-4x speedup with static argument optimization
- **`predict_trajectory`**: Full trajectory generation with same optimizations
- **`train_step`**: slight speedup vs simply JIT compiling `compute_loss`

### Scan-based Integration
- All ODE integration uses `jax.lax.scan` 
- Enables efficient JIT compilation and vectorization
- Supports Euler, Heun, RK4, and Adaptive integration methods
- Provides trajectory visualization capabilities
- Unified `integrate_ode` function with `output_type` parameter for end-point or trajectory outputs

### Tensor Field Integration
- **`tensor_field_integration.py`**: Wrapper for handling arbitrary tensor shapes (images, 3D data, etc.)
- Automatically flattens tensor fields to vectors for ODE integration, then reshapes output
- Supports arbitrary batch shapes: `(batch_dims..., tensor_dims...)`
- Output shape: `(num_steps+1,) + batch_shape + tensor_shape` for trajectories
- Use when working with non-vector data (e.g., images, 3D tensors)

### Memory Efficiency
- Batch size inference from input tensors
- Static argument optimization to prevent recompilation
- Efficient noise schedule computation with single method calls

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import optax
from jax_noprop.models import SimpleMLP
from jax_noprop.noprop_ct import NoPropCT
from jax_noprop.noise_schedules import CosineNoiseSchedule

# Create model and NoProp instance
model = SimpleMLP(hidden_dim=64)
noprop_ct = NoPropCT(
    target_dim=2,
    model=model,
    noise_schedule=CosineNoiseSchedule(),
    num_timesteps=20

```

### Key Mathematical Concepts

#### Noise Schedule Mathematics

The implementation uses a **gamma parameterization** for numerical stability:

- **Core relationship**: `α(t) = sigmoid(γ(t))` where `γ(t)` is monotonically increasing
- **Backward process**: `z_t = sqrt(α(t)) * z_1 + sqrt(1-α(t)) * ε`
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: `SNR(t) = α(t)/(1-α(t)) = exp(γ(t))`
- **SNR derivative**: `SNR'(t) = γ'(t) * exp(γ(t))` (used for loss weighting)

#### NoProp-CT Vector Field

The continuous-time variant learns a vector field:

```
dz/dt = τ⁻¹(t) * (sqrt(α(t)) * u(z,x,t) - (1+α(t))/2 * z)
```

where `τ⁻¹(t) = γ'(t)` is the inverse time constant and u(z,x,t) is the output of the neural network.

**Critical Side Note**

The original NoProp paper has a minor mathematical error/omission for the continuous time case which 
affects inference, but not learning.  In practice it seems to have little effect on performance which 
is probably why it went unnoticed. The ultimate source of the error was likely a slightly cavalier attitude 
toward small `dt` limits resulting in incorrect calculation of the effective time constant for the forward
process.  Fortunately the correct dynamics described above do not differ from the original NoProp dynamics 
very much for  `α(t)` close to 1 so the last few time steps so despite the error the results it gives are 
very similiar because the last few denoising steps are largely indistinguishable.  See the hastily written 
and likely error riddled writeup of my derivation of the forward process in the docs directory.  


#### Loss Function

The NoProp-CT loss is weighted by the SNR derivative and normalized by batch mean:

```
L = E[SNR'(t) * ||model(z_t, x, t) - target||²] / E[SNR'(t)] + λ * E[||model(z_t, x, t)||²]
```

This ensures the model learns to denoise more aggressively when the SNR changes rapidly, while the normalization prevents large SNR' values from dominating the learning rate.

### Hyperparameters

The paper suggests the following hyperparameters:

| Dataset | Method | Epochs | Learning Rate | Batch Size | Timesteps | Reg Weight |
|---------|--------|--------|---------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| MNIST | NoProp-DT | 100 | 1e-3 | 128 | 10 | - |
| MNIST | NoProp-CT | 100 | 1e-3 | 128 | 1000 | 1.0 |
| MNIST | NoProp-FM | 100 | 1e-3 | 128 | 1000 | - |
| CIFAR-10 | NoProp-DT | 150 | 1e-3 | 128 | 10 | - |
| CIFAR-10 | NoProp-CT | 500 | 1e-3 | 128 | 1000 | 1.0 |
| CIFAR-10 | NoProp-FM | 500 | 1e-3 | 128 | 1000 | - |

## Implementation Details

### Model Requirements Summary

**Critical**: Any model used with NoProp must satisfy these exact requirements:

1. **Input signature**: `model(z, x, t)` where:
   - `z`: Noisy target tensor `[batch_size, z_dim]`
   - `x`: Input data tensor `[batch_size, height, width, channels]` 
   - `t`: Time step tensor `[batch_size]` (can be `None` for discrete-time variants)

2. **Output**: Must return `z'` with **exactly the same shape** as input `z`

3. **Time handling**: For discrete-time variants, `t=None` is allowed

### Noise Schedule Architecture

The noise schedules are implemented as `nn.Module` instances with the following key features:

- **Gamma parameterization**: All schedules use `α(t) = sigmoid(γ(t))` for numerical stability
- **Efficient computation**: Single `get_gamma_gamma_prime_t()` method computes both `γ(t)` and `γ'(t)`
- **Learnable schedules**: Neural network with positive weights and ReLU activations ensures monotonicity
- **Boundary conditions**: Learnable schedules enforce exact `γ(0) = γ_min` and `γ(1) = γ_max`

### Best Practices

1. **Model Design**: Use `SimpleMLP` as a reference implementation for simple datasets
2. **Noise Schedules**: Start with `CosineNoiseSchedule()` for most applications to avoid singularities
3. **Learnable Schedules**: Use for complex datasets where fixed schedules don't work well
4. **Time Embedding**: Ensure your model properly handles time information for continuous-time variants
5. **Shape Consistency**: Always verify that model output has the same shape as input `z`
6. **JIT Optimization**: The implementation is already highly optimized - no additional JIT needed
7. **NoProp-FM**: Use for applications where inference speed is critical, as it's faster than NoProp-CT for prediction

## Performance

The implementation achieves excellent performance with the optimizations:

- **Two Moons Dataset**: 95%+ training accuracy, 100% validation accuracy
- **JIT Compilation**: 1000x+ speedups on critical methods
- **Memory Efficiency**: Batch size inference and static argument optimization
- **ODE Integration**: Scan-based integration with multiple methods (Euler, Heun, RK4, Adaptive)
- **Runtime Comparison**: NoProp-CT is 1.5x faster for training, NoProp-FM is 2.8x faster for inference

## Examples

### Two Moons Dataset

The repository includes a complete example on the two moons dataset:

```bash
# Run with cosine noise schedule
python examples/two_moons.py --epochs 50 --noise-schedule cosine

```

This example demonstrates:
- Data generation and splitting
